# Chapter 2: Architecture Flow

The traditional approach to Software Architecture has been to work for quite a long time defining the scope, laying out components, archetypes or layers, and sometimes even building parts of the architecture blocks before the actual solution starts.

Of course this is a mismatch to the idea of adaptive design that Agile brought us. If we are supposed to discover the details of the product we are building during the project itself, and following Lean principles, deferring decisions to last responsible moment, then Big Design Upfront can't apply to Architecture either.

Indeed, what we know now is that every time we defer some of those technical decisions to the moment we learned more about the problem domain, our stakeholder's expectations and also about our own solution, we are creating more possibilities. Every time we take a decision and start working on its premise we bound ourselves a little to that. Over time, hard technical decisions are hard to change, as we always knew in Architecture, but instead of trying to take them right, we will start to take them late. Sometimes late means that we might get lucky and might never have to decide about it at all.

Another turn we take from the traditional approach is that instead of trying to figure out the "right" architecture with our stakeholders in the beginning, we typically discuss the basics, but then we don't press them with details they don't know, or they can't never be sure enough. As we are supposed to discover the product features in detail over time, and release early versions to be used in production and learn from them, the architecture would probably need to be discussed and evaluated from actual data from the design process and runtime.

Most than anything else, my strategy is to keep the conversation about architecture (mostly discussing quality attributes) open and intertwined with functional discussions, as both things go along in the system development and usage. To do that, I will explore some lightweight alternative practices that can be added to standard planning and review meetings, as well as how much to advance at product's inception.
