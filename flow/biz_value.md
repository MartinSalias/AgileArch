# Business Value

As we recognize that delivering value early and often is what makes agility attractive to our customers, then we have to be able to justify our technical decisions following the same principle.

In that sense, non-functional requirements should be derived from the same kind of experimentation we use to build the most appropriate product over time, by staying lean and refusing to include features "just in case" some possible event happens.

We strive to make architectural discussion with stakeholders, and the corresponding design decisions and implementation continuous tasks, the same way as analysis, functional design, coding, testing and deployment.

We want to have a **permanent relationship** between stakeholders and architecture (represented by the team, not necessary "architects").

To do this, we have to develop a common language accessible to everyone like other pattern languages. Among other ways to encourage this, I developed over time a deck of cards which finally became the "Architectural Tarot" (you can see the whole deck in Appendix I). The cards provide a visual approach that better engage non-technical stakeholders in architectural discussions.

We do this by using the deck not only during an Agile Inception or other kind of kick-start workshop, but frequently in iteration planning meetings, as we keep finding about the non-functional requirements as we develop the product and start using it.
