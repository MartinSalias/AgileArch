# Agile Recap

As Agile Methodologies decreases focus on written documentation in favor of oral and visual communication, I will start using my colleague's Pablitux poster to review the Agile Manifesto:

![Agile Manifesto](../images/agile_manifesto.jpg "Agile Manifesto (by @pablitux)")

The text of the Manifesto says:

> We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.

> Through this work we have come to value:

>>    **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools

>>    **Working software** over comprehensive documentation

>>    **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation

>>    **Responding to change** over following a plan

> That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

## My personal view on Agile

After almost 20 years working under the agile paradigm, starting with the early XP days by the late 90s, as you might expect, I have some strong opinions about this model and its impact in the industry and the community.

I don't think  my ideas are particularly original or important, but as the book moves into the model I found to put them to work into software architecture, I think it is important to tell you about some of them, even if this serves to set some disagreement early on.

So here I go:

### Agile is a cultural approach

I find the frequent usage of "Agile Methodologies" somewhat unfortunate. Some people still thinks that Agile is just a different way to run projects, but it is way beyond this. As Kent Beck used to say about XP, it is about **social change**.

As pretentious as the "social change" might sound, Agile is mostly about moving from __centralized__ decision-making and high-specialization to an environment of __shared__ decision-making and high-collaboration. This is somehow subversive in the sense of potentially breaking change of commands, which quickly push for a different distribution of money, power, knowledge and so on.

Of course, this is an ideal, but it is there, and I believe that continuous improvement only can get you close to that. Otherwise, improvement will slow down.
