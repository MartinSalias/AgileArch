# Agile Recap

As Agile Methodologies decreases focus on written documentation in favor of oral and visual communication, I will start using my colleague's Pablitux poster to review the Agile Manifesto:

![Agile Manifesto](../images/agile_manifesto.jpg "Agile Manifesto (by @pablitux)")

The text of the Manifesto says:

> We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.

> Through this work we have come to value:

>>    **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools

>>    **Working software** over comprehensive documentation

>>    **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation

>>    **Responding to change** over following a plan

> That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
