# Agile Architecture Challenges

Now that I discussed the Agile paradigm and Software Architecture, let's talk about the intersection between the two.

Even while agile methodologies are getting widely accepted in the development world, there is still a lot of debate about how to apply them to the architectural space. One of the most conflictive issues stems around “big design upfront,” which is strongly discouraged by agile practitioners, and the traditional approach to architectural design.

In our original paper from 2010 [^1], Diego Fontdevila and I proposed a set of team dynamics, conceptual practices, and specific technologies to embed software architecture within the agile approach—keeping up the shared goals of technical excellence, streamlined development practices, and a constant and ever- increasing flow of business.

## Architectural Dynamics in Agile Teams

One of the 12 principles of the Agile Manifesto states that “the best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.” We took this to heart —especially, the reference to our shared specialization.

While architecture is an activity that is historically performed with an emphasis on the early stages of a project, the main focus of agile development is on emergent design and iterative production— creating a series of interesting challenges down the road.

First of all, agile makes a big push toward shared responsibility and, thus, dilutes the traditional role of the architect as the one who “defines” the higher-level design of a solution. In this new approach, architecture (as most other development activities) is something that is performed by the whole team -—preserving its multidisciplinary nature. This does not imply that the architect profile goes away, as with all the other roles; it means that while someone contributes with a broader and probably more experienced perspective (usually leading in this aspect), the whole team participates and understands the implications of the design decisions that it makes, and continuously evaluates them.
